          <p>
            <strong>Mission Mike</strong> is a technically-inclined creative with a love for innovation
            and expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he&apos;s not crafting software, you can find him producing YouTube content with
            his family. He's a perpetual project juggler, serial domain registrar, and compulsive
            refactorer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing up, Michael Dinerstein was one of those kids who would take things apart and put
            them back together just to see how they "ticked."
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding the basics was never enough. His interests weren't just technical â€” they
            were also creative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Playing guitar at church services led to learning about live sound. When his parents got
            family a PC in the mid-90s his curiosity led him to learn the computer's inner-workings.
            While learning Microsoft BASIC, his first bit of code was, not surprisingly, a program
            that generated tones to play a melody.
          </p>
          <p>
            After high school, Michael (aka "Mission Mike") set his sights on pursuing something
            that would enable him to utilize both his artistic and technical inclinations.
          </p>
          <p>
            This ultimately led to Web Design & Development. This career path allowed him to
            incorporate his creative eye with a love of programming, analytical thinking, and
            learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Michael has been married to his lovely wife Yohana since 2012. They have five adoring
            children. He's looking forward to seeing if his kids might also want to know how things
            "tick."
