  This take-home coding assessment was a discouraging experience. Here's why, and how I believe
  companies can improve this process for candidates.

## Preface

I was laid off on August 5th, 2024. My position as a Senior Full Stack Developer was removed along
with a few other roles at
[The Real Deal](https://www.linkedin.com/company/therealdeal/posts/?feedView=all). As of the time of
this writing, I've been hunting for my next role and have applied to over 200 positions. The market
is rough right now.

## 0: Finally, an Interview!

I applied for a Senior Frontend Engineer position with
[canny.io](https://canny.io/?utm_campaign=please_provide_constructive_feedback_to_your_rejected_candidates)
in November, 2024. The
[job listing on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=4064305528) didn't
include a salary range, but I took a chance on it anyway:

By this point in time, I had gone for **nine straight weeks** and **_over 100 applications_** since
I had my last interview. I'd been applying for a variety of senior software engineering positions.

A couple of days later, I received a request to move forward with the next steps of the interview
process! I was ecstatic and excited - recharged after such a long drought.

## 1. Assessment Time

The test was straightforward. Canny provided a link to download a zip file, which contained some
source code for a backend and frontend application using Node and React.

The candidate is supposed to spin up the frontend and backend, then work their way through four bugs
called "Customer Issues."

For each of the issues, I had to:

1. Find the problem.
1. Fix it.
1. Draft a brief response to each customer.

Below is what I submitted as my portion of the assessment:

<Aside>

### **Customer 1:** The page doesn't load, I see 'server error'.

There were a string of issues here, I'll list them out in the order I found them.

#### The Diagnosis

1. The string `"server error"` was returned to the client instead of providing more details about
   the underlying issue. I first modified the code to provide the specific error message:

   ```js
   // Original:
   error(error) {
    const data = JSON.stringify({
      error: 'server error',
    });
   }

   // Modified:
   error(error) {
    const data = JSON.stringify({
      error, // Return the actual error here instead of "server error"
    });
   }
   ```

1. In the `HTTPServer` class, a call to `authenticateUser()` was failing with `"unauthorized"` -
   however, this was misleading because the `catch()` block was catching the error and returning a
   hard-coded string `"unauthorized"` instead of a reference to `error.message`. Ater fixing this,
   the actual underlying error message is `"Missing name in user data"`:

   ```js
   // Original:
   try {
     await authenticateUser(request, data);
   } catch (error) {
     // ...
     request.error('unauthorized');
     return;
   }

   // Modified:
   try {
     await authenticateUser(request, data);
   } catch (error) {
     // ...
     request.error(error.message); // Return the actual error message here.
     return;
   }
   ```

   This led me to the root cause...

1. The actual error message buried in this thread of incorrectly-handled errors is
   `"Missing name in user data"`. The root cause was within the dummy data in `AJAX.js`, the
   `SSOToken` decoded has a `nayme` property (typo) instead of `name`. To find this, I used
   [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to paste in the original token and check the values.

   <Image
     src="/static/images/blog/canny-jwt.png"
     width={1198}
     height={454}
     alt="JWT.io screenshot"
   />

#### The Fix

To fix, I used [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to rename `nayme` to `name` in the payload, then used the
key value from `authenticateUser.js` to generate a new token.

#### Response to Customer

_"My apologies, it looks like we weren't passing the correct property name in the authorization
token, which caused the server to fail the request. This has been resolved, please let me know if
you run into this issue again. Thanks!"_

<HorizontalRule />

### **Customer 2:** When I select 'Old' or 'Top', the dropdown doesn't update.

#### The Diagnosis

This is a rendering issue, it looks like the component is not subscribed to changes to the `sort`
object's values. As a result, it doesn't know the values were changed, so it doesn't update. I
haven't used React Redux before, so I'm not familiar with this pattern.

#### The Fix

I fixed the issue by passing in the entire `sort` object to the `Selector` subcomponent. Then I
determined whether an option was meant to be in the `selected` state based on the current value of
`sort.name`. This seemed to do the trick in ensuring the component re-rendered.

```jsx
{
  /* Original: */
}
<Selector onSelect={changeSort} selected={sort.sort} />;

{
  /* Modified: */
}
<Selector onSelect={changeSort} sort={sort} />;
```

```js
// Then in the <Selector /> component, change the "selected" prop name to "sort"
// and update a couple of conditional references.

// Originals:
const className = 'option' + (option.name === selected ? ' selected' : '');
const option = Options.find((option) => option.name === selected);

// Modified:
const className = 'option' + (option.name === sort.sort ? ' selected' : '');
const option = Options.find((option) => option.name === sort.sort);
```

#### Response to Customer

_"Thank you for letting us know about this issue! There was a disconnect between the data and the
component that was supposed to display it - this has been patched and resolved. Please reach out if
you encounter anything else."_

<HorizontalRule />

### **Customer 3:** When I sort by 'Top', the posts aren't in order.

#### The Diagnosis

It looks like the sort method is using string comparison somewhere. String "28" ranks higher than
"180" because the initial character "2" in "28" comes after "1" in "180"

> Note: This was my first idea, however after looking at the code again, I see it's a flaw in the
> custom algorithm.

#### The Fix

I had a hard time unraveling the custom algorithm because I'm not familiar with it. So I used a
standard `.sort` method with a/b comparator function. This is not a great choice if there was a
performance implication in sorting the data on the server, however I believe that overhead could
potentially be offset with a more performant query on the database side -- or, I could spend more
time figuring out where to patch within the algo. Open for discussion!

```js
// Original (common merge sort with a flaw):
export default function sortBy(array, key, descending = false) {
  const length = array.length;
  if (length === 1) {
    return array;
  } else if (length === 2) {
    const aValue = array[0][key];
    const bValue = array[1][key];
    if (bValue > aValue) {
      return array;
    }
    return [array[0], array[1]];
  }

  const mid = Math.floor(length / 2);
  const firstHalf = array.slice(0, mid);
  const secondHalf = array.slice(mid, length);

  const arrayOne = sortBy(firstHalf, key);
  const arrayTwo = sortBy(secondHalf, key);

  const merged = [];
  while (arrayOne.length || arrayTwo.length) {
    if (!arrayOne.length) {
      merged.push(arrayTwo.shift());
      continue;
    }

    if (!arrayTwo.length) {
      merged.push(arrayOne.shift());
      continue;
    }

    const valueOne = arrayOne[0][key];
    const valueTwo = arrayTwo[0][key];
    if (valueOne <= valueTwo) {
      merged.push(arrayOne.shift());
    } else if (valueTwo < valueOne) {
      merged.push(arrayTwo.shift());
    }
  }

  return descending ? merged.reverse() : merged;
}

// Modified:
export default function sortBy(array, key, descending = false) {
  return array.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a[key] === b[key]) return 0; // The same value, no sorting needed.

    // The value of `descending` determines whether or not to reverse the sort.
    return (a[key] > b[key] ? 1 : -1) * (descending ? -1 : 1);
  });
}
```

#### Response to Customer

_"Thank you for catching this! It looks like our sorting algorithm had a bug. This has been fixed,
please let me know if all looks good on your end. Thank you!"_

<HorizontalRule />

### **Customer 4:** The vote counter in the top right of the page doesn't always update correctly.

#### The Diagnosis

This appears to be a render issues because the value of `votes` isn't changing, so the component
doesn't re-render.

#### The Fix

I removed the separate `recountVotes` logic and included it directly within the state updates in the
`PostsLoaded` reducer. This way, it's always updated on time and doesn't get delayed.

```js
    // Original:
    case PostsLoaded: {
      return {
        ...state,
        error: null,
        pages: action.pages,
        posts: action.posts,
      };
    }

    case RecountVotes: {
      // ...
    }

    // Modified:
    case PostsLoaded: {
      return {
        ...state,
        error: null,
        pages: action.pages,
        posts: action.posts,

        // Remove the RecountVotes case and place logic within PostsLoaded here.
        votes: action.posts.reduce((prev, post) => {
          return prev + post.votes;
        }, 0),
      };
    }
```

Then, in the `dispatch`:

```js
// Original:
(dispatch) => ({
  fetchPosts: (params) => {
    dispatch(fetchPosts(params));
    return dispatch(recountVotes());
  },
  // ...
})

// Modified:
(dispatch) => ({
  fetchPosts: (params) => {
    return dispatch(fetchPosts(params));
    // Removed the separate recountVotes dispatch.
  },
  // ...
})
```

#### Response to Customer

_"Thank you so much for letting us know about this issue. The underlying issue had to do with the
order in which data was being processed after being fetched. We've fixed this issue, please do let
us know if something else pops up!"_

<HorizontalRule />

### Notes on Solutions

This assessment took me much longer to complete than I anticipated. This largely had to do with two
areas:

1. I got lost in the weeds on the divide & conquer algorithm. I'm not familiar enough with this, and
   I spent too much time trying to fix what was in place rather than replacing it with something
   that worked. In a team environment, this may not be the best approach though, and I'd spend more
   time understanding the original code and fixing it in place if I felt it was better that way.
1. I've never used React Redux before outside of a brief tutorial years ago. So I had to take a bit
   of time to understand how the state was being handled. This ate up a bunch of time.

### Notes on My Assessment Experience

Thank you for putting this assessment together!

I found when troubleshooting and getting familiar with the code, I'd make some changes here and
there - however, without `git` tracking in place, it was difficult to stay on top of where changes
were made. For future test-takers, it would be much easier to be able to clone or fork a GitHub
repo, then open a PR with the fixes. This would help with transparency in reviewing the changes, as
well as during the dev/debugging process.

Thanks again for your consideration!

</Aside>

**Phew!** What a test!

This was supposed to take between _45 minutes_ and _2 hours_.... but I completed it in _just_ under
2.5:

I followed up to let the recruiter know. This was on Monday, November 4th, 2024:

## 2. The Rejection

Three days later, on Thursday 11/7, I received an email with the subject "Canny Assessment."

Could this be it? Am I moving forward? Will I have a chance to discuss my submission with somebody
from this company and learn more about the org?

<Image
  src="/static/images/blog/canny-rejection-email-full.png"
  width={600}
  height={361}
  alt="The big rejection email"
/>

I read _"Unfortunately, we've decided not to move forward at this time."_ and my heart sank.

However, this isn't the first rejection I've faced, so it didn't slow me down. This job just wasn't
for me, oh well...

I was truly curious, however, as to what drove this decision. The response was so canned and
vague...

- Was it my code?
- Did they not like my sort?
- Did I miss something in my debugging?
- Was I supposed to refactor to clean up the codebase (it was really messy)?

I had to ask.

<Image
  src="/static/images/blog/canny-michael-third-response.png"
  width={647}
  height={232}
  alt="My third response follow up after submitting"
/>

I didn't receive a response.

ðŸ¦— ðŸ¦— ðŸ¦—

For days.

Until...

I shared my story on LinkedIn and
[my post went somewhat viral](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaeldinerstein_company-wont-tell-me-why-they-didnt-like-activity-7263100680138031104-Mlc5)
(at least viral _to me_, as it's the most engagement I've ever had to date on LinkedIn!)

Since Canny wasn't willing to provide feedback on my test, I decided to upload my test code to
GitHub with hopes of getting some eyes on it. Then, I opened a PR with all my changes and described
my thinking process and changes in comments. I received some feedback from comments on LinkedIn
about the code and the discouraging experience I shared.

Overall the feedback was quite uplifting and informative.

I also learned that a few other people in the comments have gone through the same experience with
the same company.

Then I received a response to my email **11 days later**:

<Image
  src="/static/images/blog/canny-takedown-request.png"
  width={1280}
  height={1049}
  alt="Code takedown request"
/>

At first I obliged, and left some feedback for them:

<Image
  src="/static/images/blog/canny-takedown-request-response.png"
  width={1494}
  height={848}
  alt="Code takedown request response"
/>

...however, after more consideration, I decided to republish it.

I felt like I was being punked when they spent time to request that I take down the repository and
provide all their excuses why I should take it down... when they couldn't respond to my simple
request for clarity on my assessment rejection.

A few days later, I received a
[DMCA copyright infringement notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/11/2024-11-22-canny.md)
from GitHub. It seems that Canny reported the repository and had it
[forcibly removed](https://github.com/missionmike/technical-assessment-review-canny).

Oh well!

## 3. Takeaways

### Candidate Feedback is Important

As a candidate, I was excited about the prospect of working for a new company that seems to tackle
some interesting challenges. I spent time researching the company's website, learning about their
product, and getting familiar with the team page. I wanted to be prepared to meet with them during
my first interview! Because surely after this assessment there's an interview, right?

Wrong (for me).

There was an interview for someone.. maybe. Just not me.

**And that's OK!**

**This is the part that I wasn't OK with:** _"Unfortunately, we've decided not to move forward at
this time."_

Why isn't this OK? **It provides zero context.** No information about WHY we're not moving forward.

- Did I fail the assessment?
- If I failed... why? Which part? Some? All?
- Did they even look at my code?
- Did they hire someone else already before they could meet with me?
- Did they close the role?

So many questions. No answers.

**I firmly believe that candidates should receive feedback from take-home assessments.** Even if
it's brief, candidates deserve information.

In this particular experience, Canny had the opportunity to provide feedback, especially after I
asked them directly. Instead, they chose to ignore me, just as they disregard who-knows-how-many
other candidates.

### This Isn't Unique

This situation isn't unique. I've gone through this with other companies before. It's rude and
disrespectful.

My Canny experience was a final straw and I decided to share my experience online. Normally I'd
bottle it up and move on... but that is unhealthy.

Sharing my story led to many conversation on LinkedIn, a DMCA takedown on GitHub, and finally this
blog post - where I plan to keep this experience documented for myself and others.

### Message to Companies and Hiring Managers

If you are sending candidates take-home assessments as part of your process, you should budget a
small amount of time to share reasons for rejection with those who don't move forward.

Why?

Because it's considerate and respectful.

Perhaps it's been a while since you've been in need of work or had to interview, and you've
forgotton all the stress and anxiety that goes along with that process. That's OK, it's easy to get
comfortable and forget.

However, now that you've been reminded - please make the hiring landscape a better place for all.

### Message to Candidates

Has this happened to you?

Share it. Talk about it.

It's not healthy to store up resentment. It's not OK for companies to treat us like this. Speak up
and decompress. I did, and I sure do feel a lot better - and I made some new friends and connections
along the way.

Onward!
