Internet Explorer, amirite? While building a medium-traffic
[WordPress + Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/wordpress/) site, I reviewed analytics to see
how much Internet Explorer support I needed to provide. We had about 0.02% of visitors using IE in
the past year, so a very small drop in the bucket.

However, visitors are visitors, and I wanted to be sure they received a decent experience\*, even if
they’re using an indecent browser\*\*. Who knows, perhaps they’re visiting from Windows Vista on
Grandma’s computer, or from an outdated public library computer network.

I didn’t want to layer up IE conditionals in the `<head>`, and I didn’t want to have an obtuse
amount of JS in the bundle, just to detect IE.

After some digging, I discovered that `document.documentMode` is an
[IE-only property](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_doc_documentmode.asp)! Thank heavens! This
meant I could add a quick snippet to gatsby-browser.js, and call it a day.

Here’s the snip:

<CodeHeader>gatsby-browser.js</CodeHeader>

```javascript
export const onClientEntry = () => {
  /**
   * Detect IE visitor
   * @link https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_doc_documentmode.asp
   */
  if (window && window.document && window.document.documentMode) {
    /**
     * Redirect IE visitor or show popup, etc.
     */
    window.location.href = '/unsupported/';
  }
};
```

Happy coding!

\*By “decent experience” here, I mean… redirect them to a page asking the visitor to upgrade their
browser. Not bending over backwards to polyfill everything for IE for 0.02%.

\*\*By “indecent browser”… sorry not sorry. It’s always been a headache to build websites to support
IE. Besides, it’s slated for retirement on June 15, 2022.
