If you’ve worked with the Google My Business admin interface, you know that tracking down specific
details (especially when working with hundreds of listings) can be a daunting task. This often
requires digging into individual listings to pull various insights and data.

Combing through all these listings and copy/pasting pertinent info into a spreadsheet is cumbersome
at best. True, you can export most of the data, but as of the time of this writing, this data does
not include the CID!

This week, a member of the SEO team and I were working on updating the
[schema.org markup](https://schema.org/LocalBusiness) and
[JSON-LD](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/local-business) data for many unique
location webpages. One item in particular that required attention is the
[hasMap property.](https://authoritynw.com/blog/adding-schema-markup-to-maps-urls/) I was advised
that this property is best used in tandem with a Google Maps URL in the format of
`https://maps.google.com/maps?cid=YOURCIDNUMBER`

The challenge we were faced with, was tracking down this CID number within Google My Business (GMB).
After finding it, I had to plug it into a custom field used to populate the schema markup within our
WordPress website. Sure, I could click into each GMB location, and find a link to the Maps listing,
then parse the CID from the URL manually – but I didn’t want to lose an entire day on this mundane
clicking + copy/paste.

## The Solution: Executing JavaScript in the Console.

I wrote a quick
[snippet of JavaScript](https://gist.github.com/missionmike/667bf157d7a0c11a17f097383a21b535) which,
when pasted in the console, iterates through each row in the main GMB list of locations, and
converts the data to tab-delimited TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format. It then copies this data to
the clipboard (including a new column for the CID code, as well as a well-formatted Maps URL). The
CID is parsed from the “See your profile” button.

## Executing the Script in Console

After running the script, the TSV data can be pasted directly to Excel or Google Sheets, etc.

Copying 200+ rows of GMB data straight from the admin interface table into a spreadsheet took a
matter of seconds! And furthermore, the CID was present and readily available for use in our
application!

I hope this helps somebody out there, who may be faced with the same quest of “how can I quickly get
all my Google My Business map CIDs from one place?”

You can find the
[code snippet here.](https://gist.github.com/missionmike/667bf157d7a0c11a17f097383a21b535) All that
needs to be done, is copy/paste it in full into the console while viewing the Google My Business
admin interface.
