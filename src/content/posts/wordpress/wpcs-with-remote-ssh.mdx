## The Scenario:

- You‚Äôre working in VS Code.
- You‚Äôre working on a WordPress project on a remote *staging server (*hopefully you‚Äôre not doing
  this on production üòÖ)
- You‚Äôd like to use [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) to lint your
  PHP.
- You‚Äôd like to leverage
  [WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS)](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards) as
  your PHP standard.
- You‚Äôd like to auto-format PHP to help adhere to these standards.

### 1. Remote-SSH Setup

The [Remote-SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
extension for VS Code allows you to SSH into a host and edit code remotely as if you were working
locally. You get to see remote file and folder structure, as well as install VS Code extensions to
work with your remote project.

Follow the Installation and Getting Started steps in the link above to install and activate the
Remote-SSH extension in VS Code. Then connect to your remote host and change to your working
directory. If you don‚Äôt already have it, install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
before the next step.

### 2. Add PHP_CodeSniffer Standards Composer Installer Plugin

Open the terminal in VS Code and run
`composer require --dev dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer` in your project‚Äôs root
directory to install the
[PHP_CodeSniffer Standards Composer Installer Plugin](https://github.com/Dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer).

### 3. Add WordPress Coding Standards via Composer

Next, run `composer require --dev wp-coding-standards/wpcs` to install the
[WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS)](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards)
definitions and make them available in your project.

From here, you can run a command to see which coding standards are available to your local project.
Example:

<CodeHeader>Terminal</CodeHeader>

```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpcs -i The installed coding standards are MySource, PEAR, PSR1, PSR2, Squiz, Zend,
PHPCompatibility, WordPress, WordPress-Core, WordPress-Docs, WordPress-Extra and WordPress-VIP
```

### 4. VS Code Extensions

Now we‚Äôll install two extensions in VS Code:

**phpcs** ‚Äì The
[phpcs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ikappas.phpcs#review-details) extension
by Ioannis Kappas will enable VS Code to lint our PHP in real-time while we‚Äôre working in our code.
Install and activate this extension in the Remote-SSH environment.

**phpcbf** ‚Äì The
[phpcbf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=persoderlind.vscode-phpcbf) extension
by Per Soderlind will enable VS Code to attempt to format our code according to the standard of
choice. Install and activate this extension in the Remote-SSH environment as well.

Once installed, open your command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and find _‚ÄúPreferences: Open Remote
Settings (JSON) (SSH: [yourhost])‚Äù_

Within `settings.json`, add the following settings (replace /home/path/to/project/ with your own
path):

```json
{
  "phpcs.enable": true,
  "phpcs.executablePath": "/home/path/to/project/vendor/bin/phpcs",
  "phpcs.standard": "WordPress",
  "phpcbf.enable": true,
  "phpcbf.documentFormattingProvider": true,
  "phpcbf.onsave": true,
  "phpcbf.executablePath": "/home/path/to/project/vendor/bin/phpcbf",
  "phpcbf.standard": "WordPress",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

**Note:** if you‚Äôre working on multiple WordPress projects within the same remote host, you may want
to rerun steps 2 and 3 to install those dependencies in your user account, and update the
`phpcs.executablePath` and `phpcbf.executablePath` values to point that shared location instead.

Let‚Äôs Test it Out! Let‚Äôs see if it works! From the VS Code terminal in your Remote-SSH environment,
at the root of your project enter `./vendor/bin/phpcs --report=source ./`

If you have no errors or warnings, that‚Äôs great! But if you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve got some issues to
fix and a bunch of new work to do.

PHPCS Sniff Output Lots of whiffs to fix! You can try manually adding a syntax error and re-running
the test to see if it catches it. Also attempt to format your PHP to auto-fix some errors. PHPCBF
does a great job at fixing many things automatically.

### 5. PHPCS Overrides

Depending on the project, you may not want PHPCS to complain about certain errors. There are options
to include
[code comments to ignore specific sniffs or parts of a file](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Advanced-Usage#ignoring-parts-of-a-file),
but sometimes we‚Äôd prefer to have some checks skipped globally.

To accomplish this, create a `phpcs.xml` file in the root of your project. See below for a sample
file with exclusions applied via `<exclude />` tags.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ruleset name="My Project Rules">
    <config name="minimum_supported_wp_version" value="4.4.0" />

    <rule ref="WordPress-Core">
        <!-- Exclude these sniffs -->
        <exclude name="WordPress.WP.AlternativeFunctions" />
        <exclude name="WordPress.WP.GlobalVariablesOverride" />
        <exclude name="WordPress.DB.RestrictedClasses" />
    </rule>
    <rule ref="WordPress-Docs" />
    <rule ref="WordPress-Extra" />

    <!-- Check all PHP files in directory tree by default. -->
    <arg name="extensions" value="php" />
    <file>.</file>

    <!-- Add exclude patterns here -->
    <exclude-pattern>/tests/*</exclude-pattern>
    <exclude-pattern>/vendor/*</exclude-pattern>
</ruleset>
```

## Bonus: Using PHPCS in CI/CD

Now that you have the PHPCS dev dependencies saved in `composer.json` as part of your project, you
can leverage PHPCS within your CI/CD workflows to run PHP_CodeSniffer with WordPress Coding
Standards and your own custom `phpcs.xml` overrides within your CI/CD pipeline.

There are a couple of ways to do this:

#1. Incorporate a `./vendor/bin/phpcs --report=summary .` (or variation) command within the pipeline
after `composer install`

#2. Add said command above as an npm script within `package.json`, then run that script during the
pipeline (also after composer install.

I prefer #2 because it allows me to define the specific PHPCS linting script in one location, and
then call it from wherever needed: either locally, or within the pipeline. If I have this script,
for example:

```json
...
"scripts": {
  "phpcs": "./vendor/bin/phpcs --report=summary ."
},
...
```

I can then use `npm run phpcs` locally whenever I feel like manually running phpcs, or I can include
npm run phpcs at some point during my pipeline.

**Until next time! Happy (clean) coding.**
