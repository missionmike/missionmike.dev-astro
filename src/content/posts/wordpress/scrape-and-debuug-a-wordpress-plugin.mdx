summary:
  Preview your posts and pages on social media. Validate your pages’ HTML with W3C’s Validator, or
  check PageSpeed with Google’s PageSpeed Insights. Access these tools quickly from within wp-admin,
  without needing to copy/paste multiple URLs each time to see your results.

Have you ever found yourself making minor edits to a featured image, or description blurb, and then
re-running the URL through Facebook’s Share Debugger, or the Google Rich Results Test?

I have. It got tiring. All that copy/pasting of URLs, tab switching, refreshing. So I created a
plugin that made it easier – after installation and choosing which post types you want to be able to
check with it, you can click which service you want to run your post/page through, and it opens it
up in a new tab and scrapes it. Check out this video to see how it works:

<div className="w-full relative">
  <iframe

    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
    className="w-full relative responsive"
  ></iframe>
</div>

If you try this plugin, please reach out and let me know your thoughts! I’d love to know if it’s
helped anyone else. Of course, let me know if you run into issues with it, or open a support ticket
on wordpress.org and I’ll get it fixed up ASAP.
