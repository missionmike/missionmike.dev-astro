Does your toddler ever want to mash the keyboard that you're _trying_ to use? Well, set up an old
beater laptop and send them to <a href="https://www.smashkeys.org/">www.smashkeys.org</a>

**Then they can work _alongside_ you!**

This was today's afternoon side quest, inspired by baby
[Memphis Jay](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnwtt-L_fvebVe1QmNfIhfPaIcoON3Vzc), who refuses
to let me work on my laptop without his express involvement:

<div class="video-container-short">
  <iframe
    width="513"
    height="912"

    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

## Future features? Maybe...

- Relaxing low-stim sounds on keypress
- More random emojis
- Cool, smooth animations
- Themes?
- Maybe as they smash random keys, it types real words?
- Maybe as they type random keys, it moves them through a "game"?

Open to contributions!

Let me know if this keeps your kid entertained for more than 3 seconds, I'd love to hear about it.
