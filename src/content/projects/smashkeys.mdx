Does your toddler ever want to mash the keyboard that you're _trying_ to use? Well, set up an old
beater laptop and send them to <a href="https://www.smashkeys.org/">www.smashkeys.org</a>

**Then they can work _alongside_ you!**

This was today's afternoon side quest, inspired by baby
[Memphis Jay](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnwtt-L_fvebVe1QmNfIhfPaIcoON3Vzc), who refuses
to let me work on my laptop without his express involvement:

<div class="video-container-short">
  <iframe
    width="513"
    height="912"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKQ8CO3lVJE"
    title="Memphis Jay debugs some code"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

But guess what! This website probably won't help anyway, because baby will want to use the computer
that YOU'RE working on, so... yeah.

Either way, I've had this idea on the back burner for a while, finally felt the burst of motivation
to knock it out.

## Future features? Maybe...

- Relaxing low-stim sounds on keypress
- More random emojis
- Cool smooth animations
- Themes?
- Maybe as they smash random keys, it types real words?
- Maybe as they type random keys, it moves them through a "game"?

idk. I have more important things to be doing, but I needed a palate cleanser.

Let me know if this keeps your kid entertained for more than 3 seconds!
